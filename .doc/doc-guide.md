Gemoetry, squaring, normalising, root and whatever hell

WHEN YOU THINK OF NEGATIVE VALUES THINK OF THEM EXISTING 
IN THE NEGATIVE ZONE AND THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE PLUS SIGN

NEGATIVE VALUES ARE LIKE STACK AND HEAP BASICALLY
-5 + -5 = -10, 5 + 5 = 10 [ BRAIN CONCEPT ]

Squaring e.g these will result in the same, you can use that to figure out distance: 
       (-3 * -3) - more vector data...
       ( 3 * 3)  - more vector data...
impossible otherwise. squaring is important when you need it for a 3d purpose
